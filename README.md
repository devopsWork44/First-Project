# DevOps Project: Find Outside Collaborators
## Overview
Welcome to my first DevOps project! This project is designed to help identify and manage outside collaborators within a specified organization on GitHub. The primary goal is to enhance the security and governance of the organization by keeping track of external contributors.

## Project Components
1. GitHub API Integration
The project utilizes the GitHub API to fetch information about collaborators associated with the organization.

2. Script for Finding Outside Collaborators
A Python script (findcollaborators.sh) has been developed to query the GitHub API and identify outside collaborators within the organization. The script can be configured with appropriate authentication tokens and organization details.


## Automation
To automate the process, consider integrating the script into your CI/CD pipeline or scheduling its execution using cron jobs.
